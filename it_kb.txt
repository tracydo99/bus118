# PASSWORD RESET PROCEDURE (Automated)
This procedure applies when a user forgets their corporate login password or VPN password.

1. The user must provide a valid 6-digit Employee ID (EID).
2. The Workflow Agent can run the automated password reset workflow.
3. A temporary password will be generated and sent to the user's secondary email.
4. The automated reset takes under 2 minutes.
5. Escalate the issue if:
   - the EID is invalid or missing,
   - the account is locked out,
   - the reset workflow fails,
   - the system returns an error.
6. Escalate as Severity 2 if automation fails.

# Comprehensive IT User Support Guide: WiFi & Network Troubleshooting

# Network Environment Overview
Our corporate network consists of: Secure corporate WiFi (Company-Secure), Guest WiFi (Company-Guest), Wired Ethernet network for workstations, and VPN access for remote work. Ensure you are always connected to Company-Secure for full access.

# Basic Troubleshooting Checklist
Before contacting IT, complete the following: 1. Verify WiFi is enabled. 2. Confirm connection to Company-Secure. 3. Restart device. 4. Ensure airplane mode is OFF. 5. Move closer to a WiFi access point.

# Troubleshooting Specific Issues - No Connection
If you cannot connect to WiFi: Re-enter corporate credentials. Forget the network (Company-Secure) and reconnect (Open WiFi settings > Click on Company-Secure > Select “Forget” > Reconnect). Check if other employees nearby can connect (isolated issue determination).

# Troubleshooting Specific Issues - No Internet
If connected to WiFi but have NO Internet Access: Restart computer. Toggle WiFi off and back on. Disconnect from VPN (if connected) and test again. Try multiple websites.

# Troubleshooting Specific Issues - Slow Connection
For slow connection or dropped signal: Move away from conference rooms with many users. Reduce bandwidth-heavy activities (video streaming, large downloads). Close cloud sync tools temporarily (OneDrive, Dropbox). Connect via Ethernet if available.

# WiFi Authentication Errors
If experiencing WiFi Authentication Errors: Reset your password and try again. Ensure your device time and date are correct (important for authentication). Restart your device and reconnect.

#VPN Troubleshooting for Remote Users
VPN Troubleshooting: 1. Ensure latest VPN client is installed. 2. Restart your modem/router at home. 3. Connect directly via Ethernet for stability. 4. Try an alternate VPN gateway.

# Wired Network Troubleshooting
Wired Network Troubleshooting: Ensure Ethernet cable is fully seated. Restart the device or docking station. Test with another cable. Verify network adapter settings are enabled.

# Advanced Troubleshooting (For Power Users)
Advanced Troubleshooting: Flush DNS cache (Windows: ipconfig /flushdns, Mac: sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder). Run a network diagnostic (Windows: Network Troubleshooter, Mac: Wireless Diagnostics). Perform a speed test to validate bandwidth.

# Policy: When to Contact IT Support
Contact IT if: WiFi/Internet is down in your entire area. You cannot log in to the secure network. You experience regular drops throughout the day. You cannot access internal systems. VPN repeatedly fails.

-------------------------------------------------------------

# SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS AND LOGGING
1. For any IT issue that is escalated, logs from the last 24 hours should be collected first.
2. Logs must be attached to any ticket sent to a human technician.
3. For VPN failures, network issues, or repeated app crashes, logs are required before assigning to an engineer.
