# PASSWORD RESET PROCEDURE (Automated)
This procedure applies when a user forgets their corporate login password or VPN password.

1. The user must provide a valid 6-digit Employee ID (EID).
2. The Workflow Agent can run the automated password reset workflow.
3. A temporary password will be generated and sent to the user's secondary email.
4. The automated reset takes under 2 minutes.
5. Escalate the issue if:
   - the EID is invalid or missing,
   - the account is locked out,
   - the reset workflow fails,
   - the system returns an error.
6. Escalate as Severity 2 if automation fails.

# EMPLOYEE ACCOUNT CREATION (New Hire Onboarding)

   - Intranet-Access
   - TSLA-Basic-VPN
4. The account must be provisioned within 4 hours after HR approval.

# SOFTWARE UPDATE GUIDANCE (Company Software Center)
These steps are used to guide a user through installing software updates.

1. Ask the user to save all open work.
2. Have the user open the “Company Software Center” from the Start menu.
3. Select the “Updates” tab.
4. Click “Check for updates”.
5. Install all “Required” updates.
6. If a download error appears, follow the corresponding troubleshooting section below.

-------------------------------------------------------------

# SOFTWARE UPDATE FAILURE (Yellow Download Icon)
A yellow icon means the update is available but not downloading.

Cause:
- The device is not connected to strong, stable Wi-Fi.
- Cellular LTE cannot support large update downloads.

Fix Steps:
1. Move the device closer to a secure Wi-Fi access point (3 or more signal bars).
2. Confirm that the device is connected to the correct corporate Wi-Fi network.
3. Retry the update.
4. Ensure VPN is OFF unless the update specifically requires it.

Escalation:
- If the download stays yellow/stalled for more than 3 hours on strong Wi-Fi, escalate for manual intervention.

-------------------------------------------------------------

# NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING (Wi-Fi Dropping / No Internet)
Use this section for Wi-Fi disconnects or a user saying “I can’t access the Internet.”

Basic Fix Steps:
1. Confirm the user is connected to the correct corporate Wi-Fi SSID.
2. Ask the user to toggle Wi-Fi OFF and then ON again.
3. Ask them to test at least two different websites or applications.
4. If remote:
   - Check if VPN is needed for internal applications.
   - Confirm VPN connection status.
5. Ask if other users in the same location are experiencing issues:
   - If YES → likely location-wide issue → escalate to Network Team (Severity 2).
   - If NO → collect device name and OS for individual troubleshooting.
6. If issues persist over multiple days, collect logs and create an IT ticket.

-------------------------------------------------------------

# SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS AND LOGGING
1. For any IT issue that is escalated, logs from the last 24 hours should be collected first.
2. Logs must be attached to any ticket sent to a human technician.
3. For VPN failures, network issues, or repeated app crashes, logs are required before assigning to an engineer.
